# 5G Network Simulator (5G K-SimNet)
5G K-SimNet is implemented based on [ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org "ns-3 Website") and [ns-3 mmWave module](https://github.com/nyuwireless/ns3-mmwave "mmWave github"). ns-3 is one of representative network simulators in communication and computer network research. ns-3 models network entities and structs complete set of the network protocol stack, so it can predict network behaviors more accurately. However, conventional ns-3 lacks of consideration about virtualization effects or cutting edge of software-defined network (SDN) technologies, or support of multi-connectivity of 5G networks. For simulating 5G network system, it is necessary to see virtualized effects or SDN functions, or test multi-connectivity scenario for deployment of 5G network. Our 5G K-SimNet includes OpenFlow controller, OpenFlow switches, modules for evaluating virtualization effects and also includes mmWave module for evaluating multi-connectivity of 5G network. Users who want to simulator 5G network system can evaluate their own network system topology with our 5G K-SimNet.
