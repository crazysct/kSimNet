++++++++++++++++++++++++

This file contains OFSwitch13 release notes (most recent releases first).

Release 3.2.0 (May 22, 2018)
============================

- Updating OFSwitch13Queue to make it work with ns-3.27 release. Special thanks
  to Stefano Avallone for improving ns-3 queue environment and providing the
  patch to update OFSwitch13.

- Fixing the NetBee library repository link on module documentation.

- This version is compatible with ofsoftswitch13 library release v3.2.x and
  ns-3 version 3.27 (including patches). There is no backward compatibility
  with older ns-3 versions.


Release 3.1.1 (May 12, 2018)
============================

- Including a new counter on the OFSwitch13StatsCalculator to measure the
  pipeline load regarding the number of packets.

- New OFSwitch13Queue::QueueFactory attribute for the object factory used to
  create internal OpenFlow queues on output ports.

- Fixing small bugs when handling packet tags and refilling meter tokens.

- This version is compatible with ofsoftswitch13 library release v3.1.x and
  ns-3 version 3.26 (including patches). There is no backward compatibility
  with older ns-3 versions.


Release 3.1.0 (May 29, 2017)
============================

- Improving the OFSwitch13Device with the PipelineCapacity attribute that can
  be used to limit the traffic throughput within the pipeline to a specific
  data rate.

- Improving the OFSwitch13Device with the FlowTableSize, GroupTableSize, and
  MeterTableSize attributes, that can be used to define the maximum number of
  entries in pipeline tables.

- Improving the OFSwitch13Queue with the NumQueues attribute that can be used
  to define the number of output queues available for use.

- Updating some ofsoftswitch13 library defines to allow more entries on each
  datapath table (flow, meter, and group).

- Including the meter ID parameter on OFSwitch13Device::MeterDrop trace source.

- Including new trace sources and private member accessors on OFSwitch13Device
  that can be used for monitoring datapath performance.

- Renaming some OFSwitch13Device private member accessors.

- Refactoring the OFSwitch13StatsCalculator to dump statistics in a better way.

- Improving the logical port example with a stateless tunnel application.

- Adjust the size of queue interface to avoid dropping packets when we still
  have space on internal queues.

- Improving the way switches and controllers deals with TCP sockets from
  OpenFlow channels using the new OFSwitch13SocketHandler class.

- Updating the default TCAM delay attribute on switch device to better reflect
  real hardware operation.

- This version is compatible with ofsoftswitch13 library release v3.1.x and
  ns-3 version 3.26 (including patches). There is no backward compatibility
  with older ns-3 versions.


Release 3.0.0 (Feb 10, 2017)
============================

- Starting using the Semantic Versioning (http://semver.org) on this project.
  So, BE AWARE THAT this release brings incompatible API changes in respect to
  prior OFSwitch13 versions.

- The OFSwitch13Queue was updated to match the changes introduced in the Queue
  API by ns-3.26. No more backward compatibility is available for ns-3.25 or
  prior versions.

- Including support for multiple controllers on the same OpenFlow network
  domain.

- Including support to build switch ports over VirtualNetDevices to work as
  logical ports.

- Renaming examples files to ofswitch13-*.cc and including the new
  ofswitch13-logical-port example.

- Removing the need of registering the switch at the controller before the
  connection start.

- Removing the controller address attribute from the OpenFlow device. It now
  must be indicated by the helper as a parameter to the
  StartControllerConnection () device method.

- Creating the OFSwitch13StatsCalculator for switch performance monitoring.

- Implementing a simplified OpenFlow version-negotiation in OpenFlow device.

- Create the SocketReader class to read OpenFlow messages from TCP sockets
  safely and independently.

- Creating the RemoteController and RemoteSwitch classes, which can be used to
  independently store information of several remote connections, allowing the
  implementation of multiple controller functionalities.

- Refactoring the OFSwitch13Controller class:
  * Splitting the DpctlCommand into 'execute' and 'schedule' versions;
  * Removing dependence from OFSwitch13Device class;
  * Renaming ConnectionStarted () method to HandshakeSuccessful () to reflect
    the method semantic;
  * Implementing the handshake procedure;
  * Implementing barrier reply, hello and features reply handlers;
  * Using constant pointers to RemoteSwitch objects to avoid mistakes.

- Refactoring the OFSwitch13Helper class:
  * Using the OFSwitch13Helper as a base class and implementing extended
    helpers for configuring an OpenFlow network domain with internal controller
    applications (OFSwitch13InternalHelper) or a real external controller
    (OFSwitch13ExternalHelper);
  * Supporting the configuration of OpenFlow networks domains with multiple
    controllers;
  * Removing the dependence of installing the controller before the switches;
  * Introducing the CreateOpenFlowChannels () member function to effectively
    connect switches to controllers after installing switches and controllers
    into respective nodes (the use of this function is mandatory).

- This version is compatible with ofsoftswitch13 library release v3.0.x and
  ns-3 version 3.26 (including patches). There is no backward compatibility
  with older ns-3 versions.


Release 2.0.3 (Sep 12, 2016)
============================

- Bugfix: wrong variable type on priority output queue selection.


Release 2.0.2 (Apr 11, 2016)
============================

- Including the QosController example.

- The OpenFlow device is not a NetDevice child anymore. It avoids misleading
  interpretation and configuration problems with further ns-3 versions. The
  OFSwitch13NetDevice class was renamed to OFSwitch13Deviceto reflect this
  change better.

- Replacing the CsmaNetDevice OpenFlow trace source, used by prior versions to
  get packets from the CsmaNetDevice port, by a new CsmaNetDevice OpenFlow
  receive callback. This new callback avoids problems with internal receive
  semantics in the way that CsmaNetDevices configure as OpenFlow ports never
  invoke the default receive callback.

- Creating the OFSwitch13DeviceContainer for handling CsmaNetDevices. Note the
  change on InstallSwitch* methods on the OFSwitch13Helper.

- By default, 8 priority queues are created for each OFSwitch13Queue and are
  available for use.

- Updating the documentation with a better module design description (including
  new figures) and the QosController description.

- This version is compatible with ofsoftswitch13 library release v2.0.x and
  ns-3 versions 3.22, 3.23 and 3.24.1, and 3.25 (including patches for
  ns-3.25).


Release 2.0.1 (Feb 16, 2016)
============================

- Updating the documentation with more details on the differences between this
  module and the existing ns-3 one.

- Including patches for already tested ns-3 versions (3.22, 3.23 and 3.24.1).

- Including this release notes file.

- This version is compatible with ofsoftswitch13 library release v2.0.x and
  ns-3 versions 3.22, 3.23 and 3.24.1.


Release 2.0.0 (Feb 15, 2016)
============================

- First public release of the OFSwitch13 module, including source code and
  documentation.

- This version is compatible with ofsoftswitch13 library release v2.0.x and
  ns-3 versions 3.22, 3.23 and 3.24.1.
