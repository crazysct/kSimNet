/**
 * \ingroup ofswitch13
 *
 * \brief The OpenFlow 1.3 queue interface for simple QoS management. An
 * OpenFlow switch provides limited Quality-of-Service support (QoS) through a
 * simple queuing mechanism. One (or more) queues can attach to a port and be
 * used to map flow entries on it. Flow entries mapped to a specific queue
 * will be treated according to that queue's configuration. Queue configuration
 * takes place outside the OpenFlow protocol. This class implements the queue
 * interface, extending the ns3::Queue class to allow compatibility with the
 * CsmaNetDevice used by OFSwitch13Port. Internally, it can hold a collection
 * of N priority queues, identified by IDs ranging from 0 to N in increasing
 * priority (queue ID 0 has the lowest priority). The ns3::QueueTag is used to
 * identify which internal queue will hold the packet, and the priority
 * algorithms ensures that higher-priority queues "always" get serviced
 * first.
