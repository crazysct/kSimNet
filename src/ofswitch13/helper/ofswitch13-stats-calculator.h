/**
 * \ingroup ofswitch13
 * \brief This class monitors a single OpenFlow switch device to collect
 * statistics and write them to an output file. This stats calculator connects
 * to a collection of trace sources in the OpenFlow switch device to monitor
 * the following metrics:
 *  -# Pipeline load in terms of throughput (Kbits);
 *  -# Pipeline load in terms of packets;
 *  -# Packets dropped while exceeding pipeline load capacity;
 *  -# Packets dropped by meter bands;
 *  -# Flow-mod operations executed by the switch;
 *  -# Meter-mod operations executed by the switch;
 *  -# Group-mod operations executed by the switch;
 *  -# Packets-in sent from the switch to the controller;
 *  -# Packets-out sent from the controller to the switch;
 *  -# Average number of flow entries in pipeline tables;
 *  -# Average number of meter entries in meter table;
 *  -# Average number of group entries in group table;
 *  -# Average switch buffer space usage (percent);
 *  -# Average pipeline lookup delay for packet processing (microseconds).
