# OpenFlow 1.3 Software Switch for ns-3

This is an [OpenFlow 1.3][ofp13] compatible user-space software switch implementation, forked from the original [CPqD OpenFlow 1.3 Software Switch][cpqdofs13] and slightly modified to proper integration with the [OFSwitch13 module][ofswitch13] for the [ns-3 Network Simulator][ns-3]. This code does not modify the original switch datapath implementation, which is currently maintained in the original repository and regularly synced to the master branch on this one. The modified `ns3lib` branch includes some callbacks, compiler directives and minor changes in struct declarations to allow integration with the OFSwitch13 module. 

# Contribute

# Acknowledgments
